Description:
    hmf_friendship_generator will create a model and migration for a 
    self-referencial friends system. 
    This generator will also produce unit tests and fixtures. To make
    the best tests possible, the fixtures will be looking for at least
    3 users from your user model. Feel free to edit this to your liking.


Example:
    ./script/generate friendship_model Friendship

    This will create a model and migration:
        Model:      app/models/friendship.rb
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_create_friendships.rb
        
    You should then run "rake db:migrate".
